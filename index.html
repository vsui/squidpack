    Hi! This is the best site I have ever seen: <a href="http://smallwizard.zone">cnn.com</a>
    
    <h1>Squids</h1>
    Squids are my favorite animal. Why? Because they are sleek and nimble jets of the sea. In addition, a squid is incredibly intelligent.
    They can change color to blend into their surroundings. It no wonder they are related to the brain of the sea, the octopus. Squids dart
    through the ocean chasing prey, because they are carnivores. They have a bone-like structure called the pen inside their mantle and they
    actually have beaks between their legs!
    
    <h1>Muffy</h1>
    This is my dog. I will upload a picture soon.
    
    <script>
      console.log('squid!');
